# Endangered Animal Database Construction and Analysis
### Tighe Clough

#### Inspired by a group project by:
Tighe Clough (myself), Yuxuan Chen, Britney Chen, Sarah Tong, Amaya Kejriwal

## Background

This analysis stems from a group project in "CS3200: Database Design" at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. My original vision for the project proved too ambitious due to time and technology constraints. I have revisited the project to achieve these goals and have redesigned and updated the database. Additionally, I am performing continuous analysis on the database which I document through updates on this repo.
