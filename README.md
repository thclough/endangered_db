# Endangered Animal Database Construction and Analysis
#### Tighe Clough

## Background

This analysis stems from a group project in "CS3200: Database Design" at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. The group consisted of myself, Yuxuan Chen, Britney Chen, Sarah Tong, and Amaya Kejriwal. My original vision for the project proved too ambitious due to time and technology constraints. I have revisited the project to achieve these goals and have redesigned and updated the database. Additionally, I am performing continuous analysis on the database which I document through updates on this repo.

## Introduction

The international demand for animal and plant-derived products has caused alarming depletions in certain specie populations. While the world economies have become increasingly connected and prosperous in the past few centuries, the resulting market forces have overwheled wildlife in many cases. In 1975, 80 countries came together to address this issue by drafting and signing The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). The agreement stipulated the careful documentation and tracking of trade in threatened and endangered taxa (biological term for a group of related organisms). Currently the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Center, on behalf of CITES, maintains the CITES database which contains 23 million records of such trade<sup>1</sup>. 

It is worth noting that the database does not contain *illegal* wildlife trade. However, the global *legal* trade of wildlife reached an estimated 119 billion USD or more in 2020, while its illegal counterpart only stood at an estimated 5 to 23 billion USD<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the study of legal trade can give insights into overall wildlife trade patterns.

In this project, I have set out to create a database that integrates CITES data, RED list endangerment statuses, and importing/exporting/origin country statistics. Following the contruction of the database, I have theorized a few use cases to demonstrate the importance of studying this connected data.
